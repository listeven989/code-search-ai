## proof of concept:

summarize each file

summarize each folder

store the summarizations into a json

run cosine similarity search on it

## implementation ideas 

could be done as a single typescript file in a codebase that does the above items some could run as `ts-node code-search.ts` on a few sample queries to see if it works

great to do on a larger codebase
