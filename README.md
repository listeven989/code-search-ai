# AI Code Search

Repo to explore new approaches to code search

`/specs` 

contains ideas, implementation strategies, use cases, test cases, and more

`/chatcraft.org` 

tested some of the code search ideas to make some features for [chatcraft.org's open sourced project](https://github.com/tarasglek/chatcraft.org)

contains a few prompts, bash scripts and other code to implement a AI-driven code exploration/search flow

demo:

## TODO
- test cosine similarity search on codefile summaries as a way to find the revelant code files faster 
- write some code that takes all the files from a codebase and store it in a codebase for usage on the above cosine similarity search retrieval
