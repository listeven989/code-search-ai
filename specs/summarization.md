## proof of concept:

summarize each file

summarize each folder

store the summarizations into a json

run cosine similarity search on it

## implementation ideas 

possibly could be done as a single typescript file in a codebase 

has the logic for everything in "proof of concept"

runs through 5-10 queries as test cases on the search

user can just run `ts-node code-search.ts` to see if it works

would be great to do on a larger codebase
